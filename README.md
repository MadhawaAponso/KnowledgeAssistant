# 💬 KnowledgeAssistant using RAG with GPT-4o-Mini, ChromaDB & Vector Visualization

A question answering agent that is an expert knowledge worker .  This project will use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to ensure our question/answering assistant has high accuracy.

An intelligent, interactive chatbot built with **LangChain**, **GPT-4o-mini**, **ChromaDB**, and **Gradio**. This project allows you to chat with your own Markdown-based knowledge base and visualize document embeddings in 2D and 3D using **t-SNE**.

> 🔍 Ask your documents anything. Visualize how knowledge is stored. Run locally with ease.
